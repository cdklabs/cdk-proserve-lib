# This is a "Strict rule ordering" egress security template meant only for the egress use case. These rules would need to be adjusted to accommodate any other use cases. Use this ruleset with "Strict" rule ordering firewall policy and no default block action, as this template includes default block rules. This template will work with the "Drop Established firewall policy setting" but it does not require it. If you use "Drop Established" with this template it will generate duplicate log entries for some blocked traffic.
# This template will not work well with the "Drop All" firewall policy setting.

# Silently allow TCP 3-way handshake to be setup by $HOME_NET clients
# Do not move this section, it's important that this be at the top of the entire firewall ruleset to reduce rule conflicts
